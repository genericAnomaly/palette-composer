# palette-composer

A tool for quickly creating and previewing palette swaps for Starbound sprites.

Also a practice project to get familiar with G4P.

## Running it

It should be pretty obvious but this is in progress, so don't expect it to work yet. If you want to give it a look though, be my guest, the master branch should always run.

Obviously you'll need [Processing](https://processing.org/) installed to get anything out of this in its present state. You'll also need to install the [G4P Library](http://www.lagers.org.uk/g4p/) (Sketch>Import Library...>Add Library...). I've also made use of the G4PTool (Tools>Add Tool...) for quick UI assembly.
